Homework and Exercises for the "Machine Learning for Physicists" Course at Stockholm University 2021

I am trying to use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) here, though package support in conda for ML stuff is probably better. If you want to use conda I have an old `environment.yml` laying here.

I will be mainly working with jupyter notebooks.
